		<p>
			I've spent my career in communications â€” specifically, the information
			communications business. Through information visualization, writing, editing and
			ux design, I find the important messages and express them in the best ways
			possible. Sometimes all it takes is a few carefully chosen words. More often,
			however, the effort involves distilling mountains of information into meaningful
			and enjoyable experiences. This makes repeat customers out of media consumers.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's important to know when to collaborate, delegate and run solo. Success
			requires juggling the needs of multiple audiences on multiple platforms, and being
			a quick study doesn't hurt either. (All while on deadline, of course.)
		</p>

		<h3 class="header">How I work</h3>
		<p>
			For starters, I work well with others. As a group, we need to discover our true
			goals, define them clearly, and consider our resources. A well-scoped project is
			important to success and I always try to do things the "right way" within that
			scope. This includes accessible design and construction of web experiences.
			Inclusivity is not an option.
		</p>
		<p>
			I speak fluent front-end: <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and
			<strong>Javascript</strong>. I can get around with <strong>Python</strong> and
			<strong>Go</strong>. I'm a big fan of the SvelteJS framework. I also know others
			(including Wordpress). I like Github Actions and using Google as an ad-hoc CMS.
		</p>
		<p>
			I like to document things. It's important and future me needs a lot of help. I
			even write notes to myself, such as grocery lists, in markdown.
